#### CONFIG ####
# Number of slots to fill
numbSlots = 2

# Total time to track
intervals = 100

# Probability that a new person will show up during an interval
# Note, a maximum of one new person can show up during an interval
p = 0.1

# Average time each person takes at the teller, discretized exponential 
# distribution assumed Times will be augmented by one, so that everyone takes at
# least 1 interval to serve
meanServiceTime = 25

#### INITIALIZATION ####
queueLengths = rep(0, intervals)
slots = rep(0, numbSlots)
waitTimes = c()
leavingTimes = c()

#### Libraries ####
# Use the proto library to treat people like objects in traditional oop
library("proto")

#### Functions ####
# R is missing a nice way to do ++, so we use this
inc <- function(x) {
  eval.parent(substitute(x <- x + 1))
}

# Main object, really a "proto" function
person <- proto(
  intervalArrived = 0,
  intervalAttended = NULL,
  # How much teller time will this person demand?
  intervalsNeeded = floor(rexp(1, 1/meanServiceTime)) + 1,
  intervalsWaited = 0,
  intervalsWaitedAtHeadOfQueue = 0
)

#### Main loop ####
